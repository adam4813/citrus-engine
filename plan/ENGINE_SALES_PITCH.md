# Citrus Engine: Next-Generation C++20 Game Engine

## Executive Summary

**Citrus Engine** is a modern, modular, and powerful game engine that leverages the cutting-edge features of
C++20 to deliver unparalleled performance, maintainability, and developer experience. This isn't just another game
engine‚Äîit's a **systems-first, process-driven development platform** designed to revolutionize how games are built.

## Why Citrus Engine Changes Everything

### üöÄ **Performance That Matters**

- **Entity Component System (ECS) Architecture** with data-oriented design for cache-friendly, SIMD-optimized
  performance
- **Advanced Multi-Threading** with frame pipelining‚Äîgraphics render previous frame data while logic systems update
  current frame in parallel
- **Lock-Free Design** minimizing synchronization overhead and maximizing CPU utilization across all cores
- **Modern C++20** leveraging concepts, ranges, coroutines, and compile-time computation for zero-cost abstractions

### üéØ **Developer Experience Redefined**

- **Declarative Over Imperative** programming‚Äîconfigure behavior through data, not code
- **Type-Safe Scripting Integration** with consistent APIs across all engine systems
- **Clean-Room Architecture** free from legacy technical debt and architectural compromises
- **Self-Documenting Code** using C++20 concepts and attributes for compiler-enforced correctness

### üîß **Built for Real-World Development**

- **Systems and Process First** approach‚Äîevery repeatable task is automated or documented
- **Cross-Platform by Design**‚Äînative Windows/Linux and WebAssembly with identical feature sets
- **PR-Sized Work Units** enabling rapid, reviewable development cycles
- **Comprehensive Planning Framework** ensuring 90%+ implementation accuracy predictions

## Technical Excellence

### Modern C++20 Foundation

```cpp
// Example: Type-safe, performant component system
template<typename... Components>
concept ValidEntityQuery = (ValidComponent<Components> && ...);

class EntityManager {
public:
    template<ValidEntityQuery... Components>
    [[nodiscard]] auto Query() const -> std::ranges::view auto {
        return entities_ 
             | std::views::filter([](const auto& entity) {
                   return entity.template HasComponents<Components...>();
               })
             | std::views::transform([](const auto& entity) {
                   return std::make_tuple(entity.template GetComponent<Components>()...);
               });
    }
};
```

### Parallel System Architecture

- **Dependency-Based Scheduling**: Systems automatically execute in optimal parallel batches
- **Frame Pipelining**: Graphics systems can render frame N-1 while logic systems compute frame N
- **Work Stealing**: Dynamic load balancing across available CPU cores
- **Memory-Ordered Operations**: Guaranteed consistency without unnecessary synchronization

### Scriptable Everything

Every major engine system exposes clean, type-safe interfaces to external scripting languages:

```cpp
class RenderingScriptInterface {
public:
    [[nodiscard]] auto SetRenderMode(std::string_view mode) -> std::optional<ScriptError>;
    [[nodiscard]] auto GetPerformanceMetrics() const -> PerformanceData;
    void LoadShaderConfiguration(const ConfigData& data);
};
```
