# Colony Game Engine Implementation Roadmap

> **Strategic implementation plan for extracting a modular, powerful game engine from the existing colony game codebase
**

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to implementing the Colony Game Engine based on the completed planning
documentation. The implementation follows a carefully designed dependency hierarchy from foundation modules through
engine-layer systems, ensuring each component builds upon stable, well-tested foundations.

**Total Estimated Implementation Time: 16-20 weeks**

## Implementation Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Foundation First**: Build solid foundation modules before higher-level systems
2. **Incremental Integration**: Each module integrates with existing game systems as it's completed
3. **Parallel Development**: Independent modules can be developed concurrently within each phase
4. **Continuous Testing**: Comprehensive testing at each stage ensures quality
5. **Gradual Migration**: Existing game systems gradually migrate to use new engine modules

### Dependency-Driven Scheduling

The implementation order strictly follows the dependency graph:

```
Foundation Layer (8 modules) → Engine Layer (5 modules) → Game Integration
```
