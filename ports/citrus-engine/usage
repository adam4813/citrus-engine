Citrus Engine CMake usage:

Find and link:
  find_package(citrus-engine CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(your-target PRIVATE citrus-engine::engine-core)

Notes:
- Assets installed to: ${VCPKG_ROOT}/packages/citrus-engine_${TRIPLET}/share/citrus-engine/assets
  Copy or reference at runtime as needed. For WASM, call setup_asset_preload(your-target <assets_dir>).
- Requires CMake >= 3.28 and C++20 modules support.
- On WASM (wasm32-emscripten triplet), glad is not required; on native, glad is required and transitive.
